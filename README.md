A much easier way to program the Waveshare RoArm Ms2 robotic arm. Program 1 or 2 arms to move. Control timing delays, acceleration, schedule events and more. Have both robotic arms start at the same time. Save and load files. Edit every aspect of mission file. Easy and fun to use. No programing skills required. Just run "python main.py" from the folder. Install required libraries. They are listed in the requirements. Also supports suction endefectors. Connect the robot to computer with USB. You can set a usb port number in the main.py file. It defaults to port9 and port10. Note: the relay button controls the air relay switch for a suction cup end effector. Remeber to turn the rely off after doing something with the suction cup. If not the relay stays on and will get hot. It is super easy to program the on and off of the relay from the program. Enjoy!
